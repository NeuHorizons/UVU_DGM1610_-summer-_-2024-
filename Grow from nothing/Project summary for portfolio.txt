Game Summary:

In this game, the player's objective is to grow by eating various objects within the game environment.
 As the player consumes objects, they increase in size. However, the game also features enemies that chase the player when in close proximity and stop when the player moves far enough away.

Planned additions include a random wandering behavior for enemies and a health system for the player. 
This health system will reduce the player's health if they touch an enemy that is too large to eat. These enhancements aim to add more depth and challenge to the gameplay.
