Game Summary:

This game features a main menu that allows players to choose their desired difficulty level. Once a difficulty is selected, the game begins with various prefabs spawning at random locations then flying upwards and fall backdown.
 Players must click on these prefabs to make them explode or pop. Clicking on a prefab will either add or subtract points from the player's score, depending on whether it was a good or bad prefab.
The game includes a mechanic that ends the game if a good prefab falls bellow a cirtain location. When this happens, a game over screen appears, allowing the player to restart the game with the press of a button.
