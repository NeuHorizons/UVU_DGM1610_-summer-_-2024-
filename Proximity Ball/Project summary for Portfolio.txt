Project Summary:

This project involves a ball that interacts dynamically with the cursor. When the cursor approaches the ball, a line extends from the ball to the cursor. If the cursor moves outside a certain radius, the line gradually shortens until it disappears. The line reappears once the cursor comes back within the specified radius.

To enhance the project, spawning mechanics and physics were added. The balls now randomly spawn at the top of the screen and fall like snowflakes, creating a visually appealing and dynamic cosmetic effect.
